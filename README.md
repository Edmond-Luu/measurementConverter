This project is an expanded version of my [Temperature Converter project](https://github.com/edmond-luu/temperatureConverter) and is my largest Javascript project. In addition to the temperature conversions, the Measurement Converter also includes conversions between the imperial and the (superior) metric system for length, volume, mass, area, and pressure.

For aesthetics, the CSS Bulma framework is used which enhances the appearance of the buttons and input options on the application.

## Here are some notable features of this application: ##
* When the switch button is clicked, the text at the top, which either reads "Imperial to Metric" or "Metric to Imperial" will be reversed and the all options in the unit selections will be updated accordingly as well.
* When the user changes the units for conversion (on the left side), the measurement unit abbreviation below will immediately update accordingly.
* Then finally, once the user inputs the desired values and clicks on the convert button, the conversion result will be appended to the right side of the approximate sign.
