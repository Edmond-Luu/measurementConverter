This project is an expanded version of my Temperature Converter project and is my largest Javascript project. The Measurement Converter also includes conversions between the imperial and the (superior) metric system for length, volume, area, and pressure.

For aesthetics, the CSS Bulma framework is used which would enhance the appearance of the buttons and input options on the application.

When the switch button is clicked, the text at the top, which either reads "Imperial to Metric" or "Metric to Imperial" will be reversed and the all options in the unit selections will be updated as well.

When the user changes the units for conversion (on the left side), the abbreviation of the measurement below will be updated immediately.

Then finally, once the user inputs the desired values and clicks on the convert button, the conversion result will be appended to the right side of the approximate sign.
